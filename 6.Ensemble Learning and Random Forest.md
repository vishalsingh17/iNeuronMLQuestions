Q171. If your AdaBoost ensemble underfits the training data, which hyperparameters
should you tweak and how?

Q172. If your Gradient Boosting ensemble overfits the training set, should you increase
or decrease the learning rate?

Q171. Load the [MNIST data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv), and split it into a training set, a
validation set, and a test set (e.g., use 50,000 instances for training, 10,000 for val‐
idation, and 10,000 for testing). Then train various classifiers, such as a Random
Forest classifier, an Extra-Trees classifier, and an SVM classifier. Next, try to com‐
bine them into an ensemble that outperforms each individual classifier on the
validation set, using soft or hard voting. Once you have found one, try it on the
test set. How much better does it perform compared to the individual classifiers?

Q172. Run the individual classifiers from the previous question to make predictions on
the validation set, and create a new training set with the resulting predictions:
each training instance is a vector containing the set of predictions from all your
classifiers for an image, and the target is the image’s class. Train a classifier on
this new training set. Congratulations, you have just trained a blender, and
together with the classifiers it forms a stacking ensemble! Now evaluate the
ensemble on the test set. For each image in the test set, make predictions with all
your classifiers, then feed the predictions to the blender to get the ensemble’s pre‐
dictions. How does it compare to the voting classifier you trained earlier?
