## Linear Regression Algorithms
Q31. What is meant by regression?

Q32. What is meant by linear regression?
Modelling technique to predict continuous values where the independent features follow a linear trend

Q33. Write a python function that take an input value, weight and bais as an input and returns the returns the prediction.

Q34. What is normal equation?

Q35 What is an error?

Q36. What is the difference between error and cost function?

Q37. What is gradient descent?

Q38. What is random initialization in gradient descent?

Q39. What is the role of learning rate?

Q40. What will happen if the learning rate is too less?

Q41 What will happen if the learning rate is too large?

Q42. What is local and global minima?

Q43. What is batch gradient descent?

Q44. What is gradient ascent?

Q45. What is stochastic gradient descent?
stochastic - random and SGD - we are updting gradients for 1 record at a time 

Q46. What is mini batch gradient descent?

Q47. Explain polymonial regression mathematically.

Q48. How learning curves avoids underfitting and overfitting problems?

Q49. What is regularization?

Q50. How ridge regression helps reduce the overfitting problem?

Q51. How lasso regression helps reduce the overfitting problem?

Q52. What is the difference between ridge and lasso regression?

Q53. Explain Elastic Net.

Q54. How can we use early stopping to reduce overfitting?

Q55. How is logistic regression used for classification?

Q56. Explain the use of softmax function in logistic regression.

Q57. Can we use logistic regression for multiclass classification?

Q58. What is a decision boundary?

Q59. Explain softmax regression.

Q60. What is cross entropy?

Q61. Which Linear Regression training algorithm can you use if you have a training
set with millions of features?

Q62. Suppose the features in your training set have very different scales. Which algorithms might suffer from this, and how? What can you do about it?

Q63. Can Gradient Descent get stuck in a local minimum when training a Logistic
Regression model?

Q64. Do all Gradient Descent algorithms lead to the same model, provided you let
them run long enough?

Q65. Suppose you use Batch Gradient Descent and you plot the validation error at
every epoch. If you notice that the validation error consistently goes up, what is
likely going on? How can you fix this?

Q66. Is it a good idea to stop Mini-batch Gradient Descent immediately when the validation error goes up?

Q67. Which Gradient Descent algorithm (among those we discussed) will reach the
vicinity of the optimal solution the fastest? Which will actually converge? How
can you make the others converge as well?

Q68. Suppose you are using Polynomial Regression. You plot the learning curves and
you notice that there is a large gap between the training error and the validation
error. What is happening? What are three ways to solve this?

Q69. Suppose you are using Ridge Regression and you notice that the training error
and the validation error are almost equal and fairly high. Would you say that the
model suffers from high bias or high variance? Should you increase the regulari‐
zation hyperparameter α or reduce it?

Q70. Implement Batch Gradient Descent with early stopping for Softmax Regression
(without using Scikit-Learn).
